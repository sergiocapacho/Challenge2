After performing the analysis between the stocks that Steve selected in accordance with his parents investment objectives there were very interesting insights that will have a determinant value to them at the time of taking any decision. 

First of all, “DQ” performance during 2017 -2018 was completely different. Although in 2007 it was a return of investment of 199.4%, in 2018 lost 62.6%. Meaning that if Steves’ parents objectives are short term, it might be not the be not the best idea to invest everything in this stock. However, they can still invest a percentage of their fund in “DQ” and take advantage of the cheap price as market conditions in 2018 were not favorable.

The best stocks according to the performance were “ENPH” and “RUN”. The first one it’s been having an excellent behaviour both years, gaining more than 200% returns during these years, and its daily volume increase almost three times by 2018 meaning that has great liquidity. “Run” on the other hand has had a not so impressive performances bur it has managed to have positive ROI both years and doubling its total daily volume by 2018, this might be a sign that it’s gaining trust from the market and its a good time to invest.
